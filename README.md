## Introduction

This project is showcasing the famous [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm). I made it in order to improve my css, html and typescript skills. All in all I am satisfied with my code and the features of this app. However I think there are still alot of things to improve. For example its desktop only and not suited for phones or tablets. Furthermore I became weak and was to lazy to code a dialog/modal in pure css/html so I used the dependency [react-modal](https://reactcommunity.org/react-modal/).

#### Technologies

- Typescript
- ReactJS
- HTML
- CSS
